# Understand licensing in new Outlook for Windows

## Single account scenarios in new Outlook

To use the Outlook for Windows desktop app (either the classic or new version) with a Microsoft 365 organizational email address, you need to purchase a plan that includes the desktop versions of the Microsoft 365 apps. Various pricing options are available for [Small Businesses](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/business), [Enterprises](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/office365-plans-and-pricing), Schools, and Governments, either directly on the website or through partners. For example, a Business Standard or Business Premium plan provides access to a Microsoft 365 email address and the desktop versions of Outlook and other Microsoft 365 apps. The Business Basic plan provides access to productivity tools through the web and mobile versions of Outlook and Microsoft 365.

## Multiple work or school account scenarios in new Outlook

Some organizations choose to provide multiple email addresses with different licenses to their users. In classic Outlook for Windows, users could install and activate the desktop app with an initial account properly licensed for desktop use (for example, Business Standard or Enterprise E3). Once Outlook properly licensed that initial account, users could add secondary accounts licensed for other products such Business Basic and Enterprise E1.

When you add an account to new Outlook for Windows, the license of that account is read. If you add an account with a Business Standard license (or any account that includes a license for desktop apps), that license applies. You can then add other secondary email accounts regardless of their licensing status (for example, Business Basic) at any time. Other secondary accounts also apply to personal accounts licensed for subscriptions such as Microsoft 365 Personal or Family, as these plans also include the license rights to the Microsoft 365 applications for desktop. Once you add an account with a qualifying license to Outlook, you can add secondary accounts with licenses for products that don't include the desktop apps such as Business Basic or E1.

Since July 2024, Outlook checks the license of all accounts added to the app. Therefore, if any account logged into the app has a license to use the desktop applications, you can add other types of accounts to the app.

### Can Microsoft 365 accounts with a Frontline license be added to new Outlook?

No. [Microsoft 365 for frontline workers](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/frontline) help support employees whose primary function is to work directly with customers or the general public. For example, providing services, support, and selling products, or employees directly involved in the manufacturing and distribution of products and services. Users with these licenses are required to use the web and mobile versions of Outlook and Microsoft 365 apps. For more information, see [Changing from a Microsoft 365 E plan to a Microsoft 365 F plan](/microsoft-365/frontline/switch-from-enterprise-to-frontline).
